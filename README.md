# daily-planner

## Description

I have created a daily planner to help keep track of plans and tasks through out the day from 8am - 6pm. For times that are in the past, the blocks will be gray. For current time, the block will be red. For all future tasks, the blocks will be green. You can also find the current date and time at the top of the screen to help you keep track of your day. Mid page you will find a "Clear ALL the STUFF" button that will clear the local storage as well as the text within the blocks.
